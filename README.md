# XOver
A primitive local "remote" desktop program written in Java.<br />
<br />

<br />
(Download as zip, then unpack and run the launcher.<br />
NOTE: You can create a shortcut to the launcher to make things simpler or run the wanted service (client or server) from its respective JAR. Please do not move files out of OR edit file names in the original folder.)<br />
<br /><br />
Brief how-to:<br />
1.Download folder to 2 computers on the same network, and which are physically close to each other so you can see both of them <br />
2.Unpack and run launcher<br />
3.Choose server on one, client on the other computer<br />
4.Find out the internal IP of the machine that is running the server and type it into the client<br />
5.The server machine has now got access to your mouse and you can drag files over (hence 'x-over' or cross-over) from the server machine to the client machine etc... <br />
<br />
Obviously, this is pretty basic. <br />
I am working on a few more features including full mouse and keyboard support, live screen view (so you can display the screen of the server machine on the client machine), full support for remote connections,  and finally,  improvements to file transfer speed.
